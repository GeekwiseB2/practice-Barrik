        <h3>After leaving college, I needed a source of income.  Applying for work yielded no fruit, so when I heard of Geekwise through a friend, I jumped at the opportunity.  During Bootcamp 1, I found out I really enjoyed coding, and was apparently pretty good, since I was invited to a cohort.  After nearly making it into the cohort, I decided to take my classes more seriously in hopes of making it into the next one.</h3>
